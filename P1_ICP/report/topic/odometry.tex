\section{Odometry}
For the odometry, we have implicated it with the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check if the point cloud queue is empty. If it is, the function sleeps and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
    \item Lock the point cloud queue and retrieve the next point cloud data from the queue.
    \item If this is the first frame, initialize the transformation matrix \texttt{Twb} to the identity matrix, set firstFrame to false, and set the reference cloud to the current point cloud.
    \item Downsample the input point cloud with a voxel grid filter.
    \item Downsample the reference cloud with a voxel grid filter.
    \item Preform ICP registration with the current point cloud and the reference cloud and the guess (\texttt{Twb}).
    \item Update the reference cloud if the current frame is determined to be a key frame based on distance and rotation angle from the previous key frame, or if the time elapsed since the last key frame is greater than 5 seconds.
    \item Publish the odometry estimation result.
    \item Sleep for a short period of time to maintain a constant loop rate.
\end{enumerate}
