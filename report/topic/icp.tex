\section{ICP registration}
For the ICP algorithm, we have implemented the function with the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initialize a KdTree with the target point cloud.
    \item Initialize the transformation and previous transformation matrices to identity.
    \item Transform the source point cloud using the initial guess transformation.
    \item While the number of iterations is less than the maximum number of iterations: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find the nearest neighbor correspondences between the transformed source point cloud and the target point cloud using the KdTree. 
        \item Compute the mean-centered source and target point clouds. 
        \item Compute the $3 \times 3$ matrix $H$ from the mean-centered source and target point clouds. 
        \item Compute the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of $H$ using the \texttt{JacobiSVD} function. 
        \item Compute the rotation and translation components of the transformation from the SVD factors. 
        \item Update the transformation matrix with the computed rotation and translation components. 
        \item Check if the difference between the current and previous transformations is less than the maximum distance threshold. If so, break out of the loop. 
        \item Set the previous transformation to the current transformation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Return the final transformation matrix.
\end{itemize}
